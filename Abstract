This project introduces a smart IoT-based safety helmet for miners, 

equipped with temperature and gas sensors to detect high heat and toxic 

gases like methane. It sends real-time alerts via wireless communication 

when hazardous conditions arise, ensuring faster response and enhancing 

worker safety in mines.
